# D10 Wargame Rulebook
*The Complete Rules for Tactical Warfare*

---

## Chapter 1: Introduction and Game Overview

Welcome to the D10 Wargame, a fast-paced tactical miniatures game where strategic thinking meets decisive combat. Players command armies in intense battles where every decision matters, every shot counts, and victory is earned through superior tactics and battlefield prowess.

### What You Need to Play

**Essential Equipment:**
- **Models**: Representing your army's units (typically 20-50+ models per side)
- **Dice**: Ten-sided dice (D10) - at least 10 dice per player recommended
- **Measuring Tools**: Tape measure or ruler marked in inches
- **Terrain**: 4-6 pieces of terrain to create an interesting battlefield
- **Table**: 4' x 4' minimum playing area (4' x 6' recommended for larger games)
- **Tokens**: Wound markers, objective markers, and status indicators

### Core Game Concepts

**The D10 System**: This game uses ten-sided dice exclusively. All checks, attacks, and tests are resolved by rolling a D10 and comparing the result to a target number. Rolling equal to or higher than the target means success.

**Alternating Activation**: Players take turns activating one unit at a time, creating dynamic, reactive gameplay where the battlefield constantly shifts. You never know what your opponent will do next, forcing you to adapt your strategy in real-time.

**Combined Arms Warfare**: Success comes from coordinating different unit types - infantry, vehicles, specialists, and commanders - each with distinct roles and capabilities on the battlefield.

### Game Flow Overview

1. **Army Building**: Create your force using the point system and unit categories
2. **Setup**: Deploy your army and place terrain
3. **Battle**: Alternate activating units through movement, shooting, and melee
4. **Victory**: Achieve victory through destruction and objective control

### Game Duration and Army Sizes

**Recommended Game Sizes:**
- **Skirmish**: 500 points, ~30 minutes, 15-25 models per side
- **Standard**: 1000 points, ~60 minutes, 25-40 models per side  
- **Large Battle**: 1500+ points, ~90 minutes, 40-60+ models per side

## Chapter 2: Checks and Measurements

In the heat of battle, your units will constantly face challenges. These challenges test their resolve, positioning, or ability to perceive the enemy. All challenges are resolved through various Checks and Measurements.

### The Standard Check

Most checks in the game use a simple process:

**Determine the required value (RV)**: This is the target number your roll must meet or exceed. The RV is often defined by the opposing unit's statistic or a fixed difficulty set by the rule being used.

**Roll a ten-sided die (D10)**: You roll a single D10.

**Compare**: If your D10 roll is equal to or higher than the RV, the check is a Success. If your roll is lower than the RV, the check is a Failure.

**Example**: A unit with a Morale score of 7+ must roll a 7, 8, 9, or 10 on a D10 to pass a Morale Check.

**Critical Results**: Rolling a 1 is always a critical failure and automatically fails regardless of the target number. Rolling a 10 is always a critical success and automatically succeeds regardless of the target number, unless otherwise specified by a Special Rule.

### Distance and Range Measurements

Measuring distances is crucial for movement, shooting, and charging. Players are allowed to measure any distance at any time during the game. 

All distances are measured in inches. Measure from the closest point of one model's base or hull to the closest point of another model's base or hull.

#### Range Check

When shooting, a unit must check if the target is within the Maximum Range (R) of the weapon being used.

1. Measure the distance between the nearest models of the firing unit and the target unit.
2. Compare: If the distance is less than or equal to the weapon's R value, the shot is In Range. If the distance exceeds the R value, the shot is Out of Range and cannot be attempted.

#### Engagement Distance

Units are engaged only if in base contact with enemy units. You cannot move within 1 inch of enemy units unless charging.

### Line of Sight (LOS) Checks

Shooting requires clear sight of the target. Before a unit can shoot at an enemy, it must be able to see them. This is resolved with a Line of Sight Check that requires measuring distances and assessing terrain.

1. Choose an attacking model in the unit.
2. Check the path from any point on the attacker's model base or hull to any point on the target model's base or hull.
3. Draw an imaginary line between these two points. If this line is unobstructed by terrain designated as Blocking (e.g., Solid Walls, Large Buildings) or other units (friend or foe, unless specified), the target has Clear LOS and the unit can fire.


### Morale Checks

Morale represents a unit's collective courage and discipline in the face of danger. Units take Morale Checks when they lose half or more of their initial model count.

When a Morale Check is required, the unit rolls a D10 and must meet or exceed their Morale (M) characteristic.

#### Effects of the Morale Check

**If a unit passes the Morale Check (Success)**: It holds the line and continues to fight normally. 

**If a unit fails the Morale Check (Failure)**:
- **Normal Units**: The unit becomes Shaken. Shaken units are treated as having combat exhaustion when fighting and must attempt to Rally until the status is removed.
- **Shaken Units**: The unit is forced to Flee the Battlefield. Unable to withstand the pressure, all models belonging to this unit are immediately removed from play.

#### Shaken Status

A Shaken unit is treated as having combat exhaustion when fighting. Until this status is removed:

**What Shaken Units Can Do:**
- Defend against enemy attacks
- Roll to Rally with a Morale Check at the beginning of their activation (removing Shaken status)

---

## Chapter 3: Unit Composition and Profiles

Understanding unit profiles and composition is essential for effective army building and tactical play. Every unit in the game has specific statistics that define its capabilities.

### Unit Profile Statistics

Each unit has a profile card showing its key characteristics:

**Ranged**: The target number needed on a D10 to hit with ranged attacks.

**Melee**: The target number needed on a D10 to hit in close combat.

**Defense**: The target number needed on a D10 to avoid taking wounds from enemy attacks.

**Morale**: The target number needed on a D10 to pass Morale Checks.

### Weapon Profiles

Weapons have their own profiles showing their capabilities:

**Range (R)**: Maximum distance in inches the weapon can fire.

**Attacks (A)**: Number of attacks the weapon generates when used.

**Armor Piercing (AP)**: Reduces the effectiveness of armor by increasing the difficulty of defense rolls. 

**Example**: AP 2 weapon vs Defense 4+ armor = defender needs 6+ to defend (4 + 2 = 6). 

**Special Rules**: Any special abilities or effects the weapon has. Special rules are notated as (1/2/3) where each tier represents increasing effectiveness.

### Unit Size and Composition

**Unit Size Ranges**: Most units can be taken with different numbers of models:

• Infantry Squads: 5-10 models
• Veteran Squads: 3-8 models  
• Heavy Weapons Teams: 2-4 models
• Vehicle Units: 1 model (but may have multiple wounds)

**Equipment Options**: Each unit type has specific weapon and equipment options available. These are detailed in the unit's profile and may include:
• Ranged Weapons (rifles, pistols, melee weapons)
• Melee Weapons (sword, heavy axe, power weapons)
• Wargear (armor, equipment, special items)

### Reading Unit Cards

**Example Unit Card:**
```
Veteran Squad
Ranged: 4+  
Melee: 4+  
Defense: 4+  
Morale: 7+

Unit Size: 3-8 models
Points: 20 per model

Default Loadout:
• Lasgun (R: 24", AP: 0, A: 1)
• Combat Knife (AP: 0, A: 1)

Options:
• Replace Lasgun with Plasma Gun: +15 points per model
• Add Frag Grenades: +5 points per model
• Upgrade to Power Armor: +10 points per model

Unit Special Rules:
• [Special rules will be detailed in the Special Rules chapter with tier notation (1/2/3)]
```

Understanding these profiles allows players to make informed decisions about unit composition and tactical employment on the battlefield.

---

## Chapter 7: Special Rules

Special rules are the core mechanics that make units and weapons unique. They modify how units behave, fight, and interact with the battlefield. All special rules use a 3-tier system of effectiveness.

### Special Rule Notation

Special rules use a tier system to show increasing effectiveness. Rules are written as **'Rule Name (1/2/3)'** where the numbers represent the tier levels.

**Tier Notation**:
- R(1) denotes tier 1 of rule "R"
- R(2) denotes tier 2 of rule "R" 
- R(3) denotes tier 3 of rule "R"

Players must refer to the special rule description to see exactly what each tier provides. For example, a rule description might read "adds (1/2/3) to to-hit", where the values in parentheses are what you literally get.

**Example**: Defense (1/2/3)
- Tier 1: +1 to Defense rolls
- Tier 2: +2 to Defense rolls
- Tier 3: +3 to Defense rolls

### Special Rule Stacking

When multiple sources provide the same special rule, they stack up to the maximum tier:

**Stacking Sources:**
• Unit special rules
• Weapon special rules  
• Wargear special rules
• Officer buffs

**Stacking Example**: A unit with Defense (1/2/3) from their unit profile, Defense (1/2/3) from their armor wargear, and Defense (1/2/3) from an officer buff would operate at the maximum tier 3 level (+3 to Defense rolls).

### Universal Special Rules

These rules can appear on units, weapons, or wargear across all factions:

#### Combat Enhancement Rules

**Defense (1/2/3)**: Improves the unit's ability to avoid wounds
- **Effect**: Add the tier value to Defense rolls
- **Example**: Defense (1/2/3) = +1, +2, or +3 to Defense rolls

**Ranged (1/2/3)**: Improves accuracy with ranged weapons
- **Effect**: Subtract the tier value from Ranged rolls (easier to hit)
- **Example**: Ranged (1/2/3) = -1, -2, or -3 to hit rolls

**Melee (1/2/3)**: Improves accuracy in close combat
- **Effect**: Subtract the tier value from Melee rolls (easier to hit)
- **Example**: Melee (1/2/3) = -1, -2, or -3 to hit rolls

#### Movement and Positioning Rules

**Speed (1/2/3)**: Increases movement distance
- **Effect**: Add tier value × 2" to movement (Move and Advance)
- **Example**: Speed (1/2/3) = +2", +4", or +6" movement

**Charge (1/2/3)**: Improves charge distance
- **Effect**: Add tier value × 2" to charge range
- **Example**: Charge (1/2/3) = +2", +4", or +6" charge range

#### Morale and Leadership Rules

**Morale (1/2/3)**: Improves morale and reduces shaken effects
- **Effect**: Subtract tier value from Morale rolls (easier to pass), reduce shaken penalties
- **Example**: Morale (1/2/3) = -1/-2/-3 to Morale rolls, reduced shaken effects

**Leadership (1/2/3)**: Provides morale benefits to nearby friendly units
- **Effect**: Friendly units within 6" subtract tier value from Morale rolls
- **Example**: Leadership (1/2/3) = nearby units get -1/-2/-3 to Morale rolls

#### Weapon Enhancement Rules

**AP (1/2/3)**: Improves armor penetration
- **Effect**: Add tier value to AP value
- **Example**: AP (1/2/3) = +1, +2, or +3 AP

**Attacks (1/2/3)**: Increases number of attacks
- **Effect**: Add tier value to Attacks value
- **Example**: Attacks (1/2/3) = +1, +2, or +3 attacks

**Range (1/2/3)**: Extends weapon range
- **Effect**: Add tier value × 6" to weapon range
- **Example**: Range (1/2/3) = +6", +12", or +18" range

### Faction-Specific Rules

Each faction will have unique special rules that reflect their tactical identity and playstyle. These rules follow the same (1/2/3) tier notation system but are exclusive to specific factions or unit types.

### Rule Interactions

When multiple special rules interact:
1. **Additive Effects**: Rules that modify the same statistic stack (e.g., multiple Defense bonuses)
2. **Multiplicative Effects**: Rules that modify different aspects of combat multiply effectiveness
3. **Override Effects**: Some rules may override others (detailed in specific rule descriptions)

## Chapter 4: Army List Building

Building your army is where strategy begins. The point-based system ensures balanced, competitive games while allowing for creative army compositions that reflect your tactical preferences.

### Points System Overview

The game uses a points-based system where every unit, weapon, and piece of equipment has a cost. Players agree on a point limit for their game, then build armies that do not exceed this limit.

**Recommended Point Levels:**
- **500 Points**: Small skirmish games, perfect for learning the rules or quick battles
- **1000 Points**: Standard games, the most common format for competitive play
- **1500+ Points**: Large battles with multiple units and complex tactical situations

### Force Organization Categories

Every army must follow the Force Organization Chart, which ensures balanced armies while providing flexibility in composition.

**Required Elements:**
- **1-2 HQ Units**: Commanders and officers who provide leadership bonuses

**Unit Categories:**
- **Core Units** (Minimum 2, No Maximum): The backbone of your army. Basic troops that form the foundation of your force.
- **Elite Units** (0-3): Specialists, veterans, and high-quality units with superior stats or special abilities.
- **Heavy Support** (0-2): Artillery, tanks, and heavy weapons that provide long-range firepower.
- **Fast Attack** (0-2): Cavalry, light vehicles, and scouts for mobility and flanking maneuvers.

### List Building Process

1. **Choose Your Faction**: Select from the available factions in your game setting. Each faction has unique units, weapons, and special rules.

2. **Select Required HQ**: Choose 1-2 HQ units. These units provide leadership bonuses and often have special abilities that affect nearby friendly units.

3. **Fill Core Requirements**: Select at least 2 Core units. These form the backbone of your army and are required for a legal list.

4. **Add Support Units**: Spend remaining points on Elite, Heavy Support, and Fast Attack units as desired, staying within category limits.

5. **Customize Equipment**: Modify unit loadouts with weapon swaps and wargear upgrades.

6. **Calculate Total**: Ensure your army does not exceed the agreed point limit.

### Upgrade and Customization System

**Base Unit Costs**: Every unit comes with a default loadout included in its base cost. This represents the standard equipment for that unit type.

**Weapon Swaps**: Units can exchange their default weapons for alternatives. Pay the full cost of the new weapon:
- New weapon cost is paid upfront regardless of default weapon value
- Default weapon costs are included in base unit cost and provide no refund value

**Wargear Additions**: Units can add equipment beyond their default loadout for fixed point costs per item. Common wargear includes:
- Grenades: +5 points
- Combat Knife: +2 points
- Armor Upgrade: +10 points per model
- Special Ammunition: +15 points

**Unit Size Variations**: Most units can be taken with different model counts within their allowed range. Pay the per-model cost for each additional model, or subtract points for each model removed (minimum unit size must be maintained).

### Example List Building

**1000 Point Army Example:**
- HQ: Company Commander (85 points)
- Core: Infantry Squad (70 points) + Infantry Squad (70 points)
- Elite: Veteran Squad (120 points) with upgraded weapons (+20 points)
- Heavy Support: Heavy Weapons Team (95 points)
- Fast Attack: Scout Squad (80 points)
- Remaining points: 460 points for additional units and upgrades

This system encourages tactical diversity while maintaining game balance and ensuring that no single unit type dominates the battlefield.

## Chapter 5: Game Setup and Deployment

Proper game setup ensures fair, balanced battles where terrain and deployment create interesting tactical challenges without overwhelming complexity.

### Pre-Game Sequence

Follow these steps in order before beginning play:

1. **Agree on Points Limit**: Both players confirm the point value for their armies. Ensure both armies are built to this limit.

2. **Set Up Battlefield**: 
   - Use a 4'x4' table for games up to 1000 points
   - Use a 4'x6' table for games 1000+ points
   - Ensure the table has a flat, stable surface

3. **Place Terrain**: 
   - Players alternate placing 4-6 pieces of terrain
   - The player who won initiative may elect who places first
   - Place terrain pieces at least 6" from table edges
   - Maintain visual balance - don't create obvious advantages for one side

4. **Determine Mission**: 
   - Roll 1D10 to select a mission (see Mission Table)
   - Or agree on a specific mission beforehand
   - Some missions have special deployment rules

5. **Deploy Armies**: 
   - Follow the deployment map for the chosen mission
   - Deploy units one at a time, alternating players
   - Start with the player who will go second

6. **Determine First Player**: 
   - Both players roll 1D10
   - Highest roll may elect to choose who activates first
   - In case of tie, re-roll

### Deployment Zones

**Standard Deployment**: 
- Each player deploys within 12" of their table edge
- Units must be at least 6" from the center line
- Good for balanced, open battles

**Diagonal Deployment**: 
- Players deploy in opposite corners
- Deployment zones are 12" from each corner edge
- Creates dynamic, asymmetrical battles

**Dawn of War**: 
- Players deploy within 6" of their table edge
- More restricted initial positioning
- Encourages aggressive early movement

### Terrain Types

Keep terrain simple and functional:

**Blocking Terrain**:
- **Examples**: Solid walls, large buildings, massive rocks
- **Rules**: Blocks Line of Sight completely, models cannot move through
- **Effect**: Blocks movement and creates tactical positioning

**Area Terrain**:
- **Examples**: Forests, ruins, rocky ground
- **Rules**: Counts as difficult terrain (6" max movement)
- **Effect**: Slower movement through the area

**Open Ground**:
- **Examples**: Plains, roads, clear areas
- **Rules**: No special effects
- **Effect**: Full movement with no special effects

### Objective Placement

For missions with objectives:
- Place 3 objective markers after deployment
- Players alternate placing objectives
- Each objective must be:
  - At least 12" from any table edge
  - At least 12" from any other objective
  - Not within 3" of any unit

### Deployment Tips

**Balanced Approach**: Don't put all your best units on one flank - maintain flexibility.

**Terrain Awareness**: Use terrain to protect valuable units while maintaining firing lanes.

**Objective Control**: Consider how you'll reach and hold objectives when deploying.

**Counter-Deployment**: Watch where your opponent places key units and respond accordingly.

**Reserves**: Some units can start in reserves and enter from table edges later - use this to surprise your opponent.

Proper setup creates the foundation for an engaging, tactical battle where both players have opportunities to execute their strategies while facing meaningful challenges.

## Chapter 6: Playing the Game

This chapter details the complete gameplay engine. The game is played through a series of rounds. Each round consists of alternating unit activations until all units have been activated.

### Game Structure

**Game Length**: Games typically last 5-6 rounds:
- At the start of the game, players can agree on a specific number of rounds
- Alternatively, at the end of Round 5, roll 1D10: on a 1-5, the game ends; on a 6-10, play one more round
- Some missions may have different end conditions

**Round Structure**: Each round consists of all units activating once through alternating activation:
1. Start of Round
2. Alternating Activations  
3. End of Round

### Round Sequence

**1. Start of Round**:
- Check for any "start of round" effects from special rules or abilities
- Some units may have abilities that trigger at the start of each round

**2. Alternating Activations**:
- Players take turns selecting and activating one unit each
- Continue until all units have activated once
- A unit that has activated cannot activate again until the next round
- Each unit activation follows the complete Unit Activation Sequence (Movement → Shooting → Melee)

**3. End of Round**:
- Resolve objective scoring (see Chapter 8)
- Check for any "end of round" effects
- Advance to the next round or proceed to victory determination

**Note**: Rally attempts happen during unit activations, not at the end of rounds.

### The Unit Activation Sequence

Once a unit is selected for activation, it may perform any or all of these phases in the following order:

1. **Movement Phase** (optional)
2. **Shooting Phase** (optional, cannot be performed if you Advanced)
3. **Melee Phase** (optional, charging is always available regardless of movement type)

**Note**: You cannot be "already in melee" as melee combat always concludes when the fight ends and units separate.

#### Movement Phase

The currently active unit may choose to move or remain stationary. If moving, the player must choose to perform either a Move or an Advance.

**Move**: The active unit may move up to 6 inches.

**Advance**: The active unit may move up to 12 inches. A unit that performs an Advance may not perform a Shooting Attack in the subsequent Shooting Phase, but may still charge.

**Difficult Terrain**: When moving through difficult terrain (such as deep mud, ruins, or heavy rubble), a unit's maximum movement is limited to 6 inches, regardless of whether they choose to Move or Advance.

**Restrictions**: The active unit cannot move through enemy or friendly units. If a unit moves within 1 inch of any enemy unit, it must stop its movement. Movement must be measured from the closest point of the unit's base to the destination.

**Note**: These restrictions apply to normal movement only. Charging follows different rules (see Melee Phase).

**Unit Cohesion**: Units must maintain cohesion at all times by satisfying both requirements:
- All models must fit within a 6" x 6" square area
- All models must stay within 1" of at least one other model in the unit

**Cohesion Failure**: If a unit cannot maintain both requirements, models must be removed one at a time from the unit until it regains cohesion. These models are considered routed due to inability to maintain unit cohesion.

#### Shooting Phase

In this phase, the active unit may perform a Shooting Attack, provided it did not perform an Advance in the Movement Phase. The unit may choose not to shoot.

**Shooting Attack**:
1. Select a target enemy unit within range and line of sight of the active unit. Consult the active unit's profile for the range and attack characteristics of its armament.

2. **Multiple Ranged Weapons**: A unit may fire a maximum of three distinct ranged weapon profiles during the Shooting Phase. This rule of three applies to both ranged and melee weapons to minimize time spent resolving attacks. Each weapon profile may select a different target, provided the target is within range and line of sight. Resolve each weapon profile completely before moving to the next.

3. **To Hit Check**: Each attack requires a player to roll a D10. The attack hits if the result is equal to or greater than the active unit's Ranged Stat.

4. Resolve all attacks and resulting wounds against the target unit. Wounds are immediately applied by the owning player: for single-wound models, remove the model; for multi-wound models, place a wound token on the model to track damage.

**Morale Check**: After all weapon profiles have been resolved, the defending unit must immediately take a Morale Check if half or less of their initial model count remains.

#### Melee Phase

The active unit may now resolve any potential close combat action. This phase consists of two steps: the Charge and the Fight. The unit may choose not to charge.

**Declare Charge**: The active unit may declare a Charge against any enemy unit.

**Charge Measurement**: Measure the distance from the charging unit to the target unit. If the distance is greater than 6 inches, the charge fails and cannot be attempted.

**Charge Movement**: If the distance is 6 inches or less, move the charging unit into base contact with the target unit.

**Combat Engagement**: Once the charging unit achieves base contact with the defending unit, all models in both units are considered to be in combat. This simplification eliminates the need to measure for individual model eligibility and keeps unit cohesion tight.

**The Fight**: Once the Charge movement is resolved, the units are engaged in close combat:

- **Combat Order**: Both units resolve their attacks. The active unit (the one that declared the charge) resolves all its attacks first, then the defending unit resolves its attacks.

- **Resolving Attacks**: Each unit resolves all its attacks completely before the other unit attacks.

**Active Unit (Charger) Attacks:**
  1. **To Hit Check**: Roll a D10 for each attack from each weapon profile. The attack hits if the result equals or exceeds the unit's Melee Stat.
  2. **Defender's Defense**: For each hit, the defender rolls a D10. Defense succeeds if the roll equals or exceeds the unit's Defense stat. Failed defenses inflict wounds.

**Defending Unit Attacks:**
  1. **To Hit Check**: Roll a D10 for each attack from each weapon profile. The attack hits if the result equals or exceeds the unit's Melee Stat.
  2. **Defender's Defense**: For each hit, the original charger rolls a D10. Defense succeeds if the roll equals or exceeds the unit's Defense stat. Failed defenses inflict wounds.

**Note**: Melee weapons are resolved separately, one weapon profile at a time, just like ranged weapons.

**Wound Application**: Wounds are immediately applied: for single-wound models, remove the model; for multi-wound models, place a wound token to track damage.

**Combat Exhaustion**: Units that participate in melee combat are considered combat exhausted until their next activation. Combat exhausted units only hit on a roll of 10 in melee combat, regardless of their Melee Stat.

- **Determining the Victor**: After both units have completed their attacks, compare the total wounds inflicted by each unit. The unit that inflicted more wounds is the Victor. The other unit is the Loser. If tied, neither unit is considered the Victor.

- **Morale Check**: If the loser of the combat has half or less of their initial model count remaining, they must immediately take a Morale Check.

- **End of Combat**: After all attacks and morale checks are resolved, the units automatically move 1 inch apart from each other. They are no longer in base contact and therefore not engaged.

#### Single-Unit Combat Only

Since activations occur one unit at a time and melee combat is resolved during a single unit's activation, multi-unit combat cannot occur in this game system. Each melee combat is always between exactly two units: the active unit and one enemy unit.

**Combat Resolution**: When a unit declares a charge, it fights only the specific enemy unit it moves into base contact with. All other units remain separate from this combat.

**Multiple Potential Targets**: If a unit is within 6" of multiple enemy units, it may choose which one to charge, provided the charge can be made in a straight line to that target. The unit can only engage one enemy unit per activation.

### Rally Attempts

Shaken units may attempt to Rally during their activation:

**Rally Roll**: 
- Roll 1D10 vs the unit's Morale stat
- Success removes the Shaken status
- Failure means the unit remains Shaken

**Leadership Bonus**: 
- If an HQ unit is within 6" of a Shaken unit attempting to Rally, the Shaken unit gets +1 to its Rally roll
- This represents the inspiring presence of leadership

**Rally Effects**:
- Successfully rallied units return to normal combat effectiveness
- They can move, shoot, and fight normally in subsequent rounds
- Failed rally attempts mean continued Shaken penalties

### Special Situations

**Unit Elimination**: When a unit is completely destroyed:
- Remove all models immediately
- Award Destruction Points to the opponent
- No further activations for that unit this round

**Morale Checks**: Remember to check for Morale when:
- A unit has half or less of its initial model count remaining after taking wounds


**Terrain Movement**: 
- Blocking terrain cannot be moved through
- Measure movement carefully around obstacles

### Turn Management

**Tracking Activations**: 
- Use tokens or markers to show which units have activated
- Clear all activation markers at the start of each new round
- This prevents accidentally activating units twice

**Time Management**:
- Don't spend excessive time measuring or deliberating
- Keep the game moving at a good pace
- If in doubt about a rule, make a quick decision and clarify after the game

**Sportsmanship**:
- Be clear about your intentions when moving or shooting
- Allow take-backs for obvious mistakes
- Focus on fun and learning, especially in casual games

### Advanced Rules

**Reserves**: Some units can start off-table and enter later:
- Declare reserve units during deployment
- Starting Round 2, roll 1D10 for each reserve unit
- On a 6+, the unit enters from any table edge
- Must enter at least 6" from enemy models

**Command Points**: HQ units generate Command Points that can be spent for special abilities:
- Gain 1 Command Point per HQ unit at the start of each round
- Spend 1 Command Point to re-roll any die roll or give a unit +1 to any check
- Command Points do not carry over between rounds

Understanding these mechanics ensures smooth gameplay while maintaining the tactical depth that makes each game unique and engaging.

## Chapter 8: Victory Conditions and Scoring

Victory in the D10 Wargame is achieved through a combination of destruction and objective control, with destruction being the primary path to victory while objectives provide tactical depth and alternative scoring opportunities.

### Primary Victory: Destruction Points

The main way to win is by destroying enemy units. Each destroyed unit awards points equal to its list-building cost:

**Standard Units**: Points equal to the unit's cost in your army list
**HQ Units**: 1.5x their normal cost (encourages targeting high-value leadership)
**Upgraded Units**: Points equal to the total cost including all upgrades

**Examples**:
- Destroy a 70-point Infantry Squad = 70 Destruction Points
- Destroy a 100-point Company Commander = 150 Destruction Points  
- Destroy a 120-point Veteran Squad with +20 points of upgrades = 140 Destruction Points

### Secondary Objectives: Bonus Points

While destruction is primary, objectives provide additional scoring opportunities and tactical depth:

**Objective Control**:
- Place 3 objective markers on the battlefield (see Chapter 5 for placement rules)
- Objectives are considered circles with a 3-inch radius
- A unit controls an objective if it is within 3" of the marker (inclusive) and no enemy units are within 3" of the same marker
- If both enemy units are within 3" of the same objective, it becomes contested (no man's land)
- At the end of each round: 50 objective points per controlled objective

**Hold the Line**: Additional 100 points if you control 2 or more objectives at the end of the game

**Slay the Commander**: Additional 100 points for destroying any enemy HQ unit during the game

### Victory Determination

**Total Scoring**: Add together:
- All Destruction Points from destroyed enemy units
- All Objective Points from controlling objectives
- Any bonus points from special objectives

**Winner**: The player with the highest total score wins the game. In case of a tie, the game is a draw.

### Margin of Victory

The point difference determines the scale of victory:

**0-200 Point Difference**: Minor Victory
- A close, hard-fought battle
- Both players performed well

**201-500 Point Difference**: Victory
- A clear tactical victory
- One player had superior strategy or execution

**501+ Point Difference**: Crushing Victory  
- A decisive defeat of the enemy
- Complete tactical and strategic dominance

### Scoring Examples

**Example Game Results**:

*Player A*:
- Destroyed 70-point Infantry Squad = 70 points
- Destroyed 120-point Veteran Squad = 120 points
- Controlled 2 objectives for 3 rounds = 300 points (50 × 2 × 3)
- Hold the Line bonus = 100 points
- **Total: 590 points**

*Player B*:
- Destroyed 85-point Company Commander = 127.5 points (rounded to 128)
- Destroyed 95-point Heavy Weapons Team = 95 points
- Controlled 1 objective for 4 rounds = 200 points (50 × 1 × 4)
- **Total: 423 points**

*Result*: Player A wins with 167-point margin = Victory

### Strategic Considerations

**Balancing Destruction and Objectives**:
- Focus primarily on destroying enemy units
- Use objectives to force enemy movement and create tactical opportunities
- Don't sacrifice valuable units just to hold objectives

**Target Priority**:
- HQ units are high-value targets (1.5x points)
- Elite and Heavy Support units often have higher point costs
- Consider the tactical value vs point value when choosing targets

**Objective Strategy**:
- Control objectives that are tactically advantageous
- Use objectives to draw enemies into unfavorable positions
- Don't over-commit to objectives if it means losing valuable units

### Mission Variations

While the standard scoring system works for most games, players can agree on variations:

**Pure Destruction**: Only Destruction Points count - no objectives
**Objective Focus**: Increase objective point values (e.g., 100 points per objective per round)
**Campaign Scoring**: Award additional points for achieving specific mission goals

The scoring system rewards aggressive, tactical play while providing multiple paths to victory, ensuring that every game remains engaging until the final dice are rolled.
